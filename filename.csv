Widely available digital ECG data and the algorithmic paradigm of deep learning(2) present an opportunity to substantially improve the accuracy and scalability of automated ECG analysis. However, a comprehensive evaluation of an end-to-end deep learning approach for ECG analysis across a wide variety of diagnostic classes has not been previously reported. Here, we develop a deep neural network (DNN) to classify 12 rhythm classes using 91,232 single-lead ECGs from 53,549 patients who used a single-lead ambulatory ECG monitoring device. When validated against an independent test dataset annotated by a consensus committee of board-certified practicing cardiologists, the DNN achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.97. The average F-1 score, which is the harmonic mean of the positive predictive value and sensitivity, for the DNN (0.837) exceeded that of average cardiologists (0.780). With specificity fixed at the average specificity achieved by cardiologists, the sensitivity of the DNN exceeded the average cardiologist sensitivity for all rhythm classes. These findings demonstrate that an end-to-end deep learning approach can classify a broad range of distinct arrhythmias from single-lead ECGs with high diagnostic performance similar to that of cardiologists. If confirmed in clinical settings, this approach could reduce the rate of misdiagnosed computerized ECG interpretations and improve the efficiency of expert human ECG interpretation by accurately triaging or prioritizing the most urgent conditions.",1553,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41591-018-0268-3,No
"Yildirim, Ö; Plawiak, P; Tan, RS; Acharya, UR",Arrhythmia detection using deep convolutional neural network with long duration ECG signals,"This article presents a new deep learning approach for cardiac arrhythmia (17 classes) detection based on long duration electrocardiography (ECG) signal analysis. Cardiovascular disease prevention is one of the most important tasks of any health care system as about 50 million people are at risk of heart disease in the world. Although automatic analysis of ECG signal is very popular, current methods are not satisfactory. The goal of our research was to design a new method based on deep learning to efficiently and quickly classify cardiac arrhythmias. Described research are based on 1000 ECG signal fragments from the MIT - BIH Arrhythmia database for one lead (MLII) from 45 persons. Approach based on the analysis of 10-s ECG signal fragments (not a single QRS complex) is applied (on average, 13 times less classifications/analysis). A complete end-to-end structure was designed instead of the hand-crafted feature extraction and selection used in traditional methods. Our main contribution is to design a new 1D-Convolutional Neural Network model (1D-CNN). The proposed method is 1) efficient, 2) fast (real-time classification) 3) non-complex and 4) simple to use (combined feature extraction and selection, and classification in one stage). Deep 1D-CNN achieved a recognition overall accuracy of 17 cardiac arrhythmia disorders (classes) at a level of 91.33% and classification time per single sample of 0.015 s. Compared to the current research, our results are one of the best results to date, and our solution can be implemented in mobile devices and cloud computing.",472,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2018.09.009,No
"Oh, SL; Ng, EYK; Tan, RS; Acharya, UR",Automated diagnosis of arrhythmia using combination of CNN and LSTM techniques with variable length heart beats,"Arrhythmia is a cardiac conduction disorder characterized by irregular heartbeats. Abnormalities in the conduction system can manifest in the electrocardiographic (ECG) signal. However, it can be challenging and time-consuming to visually assess the ECG signals due to the very low amplitudes. Implementing an automated system in the clinical setting can potentially help expedite diagnosis of arrhythmia, and improve the accuracies. In this paper, we propose an automated system using a combination of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) for diagnosis of normal sinus rhythm, left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB), atrial premature beats (APB) and premature ventricular contraction (PVC) on ECG signals. The novelty of this work is that we used ECG segments of variable length from the MIT-BIT arrhythmia physio bank database.

Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a simpler, more noise-immune solution than traditional methods in multi-class arrhythmia classification. However, suffering from lack of consideration for temporal feature of ECG signal, CNN couldn't accept varied-length ECG signal and had limited performance in detecting paroxysmal arrhythmias.

Comparing to CNN model, this model features flexible input length, halved parameter amount as well as more than 90% computation reduction in real-time processing. The experiment result shows that, ATI-CNN reached an overall classification accuracy of 81.2%. In comparison with a classical 16-layer CNN named VGGNet, ATI-CNN achieved accuracy increases of 7.7% in average and up to 26.8% in detecting paroxysmal arrhythmias.

"Sannino, G; De Pietro, G",A deep learning approach for ECG-based heartbeat classification for arrhythmia detection,"Classification is one of the most popular topics in healthcare and bioinformatics, especially in relation to arrhythmia detection. Arrhythmias are irregularities in the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat which, in some cases, may occur sporadically in a subject's daily life. To capture these infrequent events, a Holter device is usually employed to record long-term ECG data. Therefore, the automatic recognition of abnormal heartbeats from a large amount of ECG data is an important and essential task. In the last two decades, a huge number of methods have been proposed to address the problem of ECG beat classification. At the same time, deep learning has advanced rapidly since the early 2000s and now demonstrates a state-of-the-art performance in various fields. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for ECG beat classification. We have conducted the experiments on the well-known MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, and compared our results with the scientific literature.

"Yildirim, O; Baloglu, UB; Tan, RS; Ciaccio, EJ; Acharya, UR",A new approach for arrhythmia classification using deep coded features and LSTM networks,"Background and objective: For diagnosis of arrhythmic heart problems, electrocardiogram (ECG) signals should be recorded and monitored. The long-term signal records obtained are analyzed by expert cardiologists. Devices such as the Holter monitor have limited hardware capabilities. For improved diagnostic capacity, it would be helpful to detect arrhythmic signals automatically. In this study, a novel approach is presented as a candidate solution for these issues. Methods: A convolutional auto-encoder (CAE) based nonlinear compression structure is implemented to reduce the signal size of arrhythmic beats. Long-short term memory (LSTM) classifiers are employed to automatically recognize arrhythmias using ECG features, which are deeply coded with the CAE network. Results: Based upon the coded ECG signals, both storage requirement and classification time were considerably reduced. In experimental studies conducted with the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, ECG signals were compressed by an average 0.70% percentage root mean square difference (PRD) rate, and an accuracy of over 99.0% was observed. Conclusions: One of the significant contributions of this study is that the proposed approach can significantly reduce time duration when using LSTM networks for data analysis. Thus, a novel and effective approach was proposed for both ECG signal compression, and their high-performance automatic recognition, with very low computational cost. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

"Mathews, SM; Kambhamettu, C; Barner, KE",A novel application of deep learning for single-lead ECG classification,"Detecting and classifying cardiac arrhythmias is critical to the diagnosis of patients with cardiac abnormalities. In this paper, a novel approach based on deep learning methodology is proposed for the classification of single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. We demonstrate the application of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and deep belief networks (DBN) for ECG classification following detection of ventricular and supraventricular heartbeats using single-lead ECG. The effectiveness of this proposed algorithm is illustrated using real ECG signals from the widely-used MIT-BIH database. Simulation results demonstrate that with a suitable choice of parameters, RBM and DBN can achieve high average recognition accuracies of ventricular ectopic beats (93.63%) and of supraventricular ectopic beats (95.57%) at a low sampling rate of 114 Hz. Experimental results indicate that classifiers built into this deep learning -based framework achieved state-of-the art performance models at lower sampling rates and simple features when compared to traditional methods. Further, employing features extracted at a sampling rate of 114 Hz when combined with deep learning provided enough discriminatory power for the classification task. This performance is comparable to that of traditional methods and uses a much lower sampling rate and simpler features. Thus, our proposed deep neural network algorithm demonstrates that deep learning-based methods offer accurate ECG classification and could potentially be extended to other physiological signal classifications, such as those in arterial blood pressure (ABP), nerve conduction (EMG), and heart rate variability (HRV) studies.",200,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2018.05.013,Yes

The wavelet transform is an effective tool for extracting discriminative features in ECG signal classification for automatic diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia. In this paper we proposed an improved algorithm to detect QRS complex features based on the multiresolution wavelet transform to classify four types of ECG beats. Extracted features are used for classifying cardiac abnormalities: normal (N), left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB), Paced beats (P) using neural network (NN) and support vector machines (SVM) classifier. The performance of the method is evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy for 48 recorded ECG signals obtained from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database.

"Tuncer, T; Dogan, S; Plawiak, P; Acharya, UR",Automated arrhythmia detection using novel hexadecimal local pattern and multilevel wavelet transform with ECG signals,"Electrocardiography (ECG) is widely used for arrhythmia detection nowadays. The machine learning methods with signal processing algorithms have been used for automated diagnosis of cardiac health using ECG signals. In this article, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coupled with novel 1-dimensional hexadecimal local pattern (1D-HLP) technique are employed for automated detection of arrhythmia detection. The ECG signals of 10 s duration are subjected to DWT to decompose up to five levels. The 1D-HLP extracts 512 dimensional features from each level of the five levels of low pass filter. Then, these extracted features are concatenated to obtain 512 x 6 = 3072 dimensional feature set. These fused features are subjected to neighborhood component analysis (NCA) feature reduction technique to obtain 64, 128 and 256 features. Finally, these features are subjected to 1 nearest neighborhood (1NN) classifier for classification with 4 distance metrics namely city block, Euclidean, spearman and cosine.

"Xu, SSS; Mak, MW; Cheung, CC",Towards End-to-End ECG Classification With Raw Signal Extraction and Deep Neural Networks,"This paper proposes deep learning methods with signal alignment that facilitate the end-to-end classification of raw electrocardiogram (ECG) signals into heartbeat types, i.e., normal beat or different types of arrhythmias. Time-domain sample points are extracted from raw ECG signals, and consecutive vectors are extracted from a sliding time-window covering these sample points. Each of these vectors comprises the consecutive sample points of a complete heartbeat cycle, which includes not only the QRS complex but also the P and T waves. Unlike existing heartbeat classification methods in which medical doctors extract handcrafted features from raw ECG signals, the proposed end-to-end method leverages a deep neural network for both feature extraction and classification based on aligned heartbeats. This strategy not only obviates the need to handcraft the features but also produces optimized ECG representation for heartbeat classification. Evaluations on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database show that at the same specificity, the proposed patient-independent classifier can detect supraventricular- and ventricular-ectopic beats at a sensitivity that is at least 10% higher than current state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, there is a wide range of operating points in which both the sensitivity and specificity of the proposed classifier are higher than those achieved by state-of-the-art classifiers. The proposed classifier can also perform comparable to patient-specific classifiers, but at the same time enjoys the advantage of patient independence.",159,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2018.2871510,Yes

"Sellami, A; Hwang, H",A robust deep convolutional neural network with batch-weighted loss for heartbeat classification,"The early detection of abnormal heart rhythm has become crucial due to the spike in the rate of deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases. While many existing works tried to classify heartbeats accurately, they suffered from the imbalance between heartbeat classes in the available ECG datasets since abnormal heartbeats appear much less frequently than normal ones. In addition, most of existing methods heavily rely on data preprocessing such as noise removal and feature extraction, which is computationally expensive, thus limits their use on low-cost portable ECG devices. We present a novel deep convolutional neural network based on state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for accurate heartbeat classification. We suggest a batch-weighted loss function to better quantify the loss in order to overcome the imbalance between classes. The loss weights dynamically change as the distribution of classes in each batch changes. Also, we propose to use multiple heartbeats for more effective heartbeat classification. Even though we use ECG signal from one lead only without any data preprocessing, our method consistently outperforms existing methods of 5-class heartbeat classification.

However, these networks ignored the fact that different channels and temporal segments of a feature map extracted from the 12-lead ECG signal contribute differently to cardiac arrhythmia detection, and thus, the classification performance could be greatly improved. To address this issue, spatio-temporal attention-based convolutional recurrent neural network (STA-CRNN) is proposed to focus on representative features along both spatial and temporal axes. STA-CRNN consists of CNN subnetwork, spatio-temporal attention modules and RNN subnetwork. The experiment result shows that, STA-CRNN reaches an average F-1 score of 0.835 in classifying 8 types of arrhythmias and normal rhythm. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods based on the same public dataset, STA-CRNN achieves an obvious improvement on identifying most of arrhythmias. Also, it is demonstrated by visualization that the learned features through STA-CRNN are in line with clinical judgement. STA-CRNN provides a promising method for automatic arrhythmia detection, which has a potential to assist cardiologists in the diagnosis of arrhythmias.",100,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2020.101856,No

"Wang, RX; Fan, JP; Li, Y",Deep Multi-Scale Fusion Neural Network for Multi-Class Arrhythmia Detection,"Automated electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis for arrhythmia detection plays a critical role in early prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Extracting powerful features from raw ECG signals for fine-grained diseases classification is still a challenging problem today due to variable abnormal rhythms and noise distribution. For ECG analysis, the previous research works depend mostly on heartbeat or single scale signal segments, which ignores underlying complementary information of different scales. In this paper, we formulate a novel end-to-end Deep Multi-Scale Fusion convolutional neural network (DMSFNet) architecture for multi-class arrhythmia detection. Our proposed approach can effectively capture abnormal patterns of diseases and suppress noise interference by multi-scale feature extraction and cross-scale information complementarity of ECG signals. The proposed method implements feature extraction for signal segments with different sizes by integrating multiple convolution kernels with different receptive fields. Meanwhile, joint optimization strategy with multiple losses of different scales is designed, which not only learns scale-specific features, but also realizes cumulatively multi-scale complementary feature learning during the learning process. In our work, we demonstrate our DMSFNet on two open datasets (CPSC_2018 and PhysioNet/CinC_2017) and deliver the state-of-art performance on them. Among them, CPSC_2018 is a 12-lead ECG dataset and CinC_2017 is a single-lead dataset. For these two datasets, we achieve the F1 score 82.8% and 84.1% which are higher than previous state-of-art approaches respectively. The results demonstrate that our end-to-end DMSFNet has outstanding performance for feature extraction from a broad range of distinct arrhythmias and elegant generalization ability for effectively handling ECG signals with different leads.",91,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2020.2981526,No
"Weimann, K; Conrad, TOF",Transfer learning for ECG classification,"Remote monitoring devices, which can be worn or implanted, have enabled a more effective healthcare for patients with periodic heart arrhythmia due to their ability to constantly monitor heart activity. However, these devices record considerable amounts of electrocardiogram (ECG) data that needs to be interpreted by physicians. Therefore, there is a growing need to develop reliable methods for automatic ECG interpretation to assist the physicians. Here, we use deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify raw ECG recordings. However, training CNNs for ECG classification often requires a large number of annotated samples, which are expensive to acquire. In this work, we tackle this problem by using transfer learning. First, we pretrain CNNs on the largest public data set of continuous raw ECG signals. Next, we finetune the networks on a small data set for classification of Atrial Fibrillation, which is the most common heart arrhythmia. We show that pretraining improves the performance of CNNs on the target task by up to 6.57%, effectively reducing the number of annotations required to achieve the same performance as CNNs that are not pretrained. We investigate both supervised as well as unsupervised pretraining approaches, which we believe will increase in relevance, since they do not rely on the expensive ECG annotations.

Recently, deep neural networks have been used to automatically analyze ECG tracings and outperform physicians in detecting certain rhythm irregularities(1). However, deep learning classifiers are susceptible to adversarial examples, which are created from raw data to fool the classifier such that it assigns the example to the wrong class, but which are undetectable to the human eye(2,3). Adversarial examples have also been created for medical-related tasks(4,5). However, traditional attack methods to create adversarial examples do not extend directly to ECG signals, as such methods introduce square-wave artefacts that are not physiologically plausible. Here we develop a method to construct smoothed adversarial examples for ECG tracings that are invisible to human expert evaluation and show that a deep learning model for arrhythmia detection from single-lead ECG(6) is vulnerable to this type of attack. Moreover, we provide a general technique for collating and perturbing known adversarial examples to create multiple new ones. The susceptibility of deep learning ECG algorithms to adversarial misclassification implies that care should be taken when evaluating these models on ECGs that may have been altered, particularly when incentives for causing misclassification exist. The development of an algorithm that can imperceptibly manipulate electrocardiographic data to fool a deep learning model for diagnosing cardiac arrhythmia highlights the potential vulnerability of artificial intelligence-enabled diagnosis to adversarial attacks.",85,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-0791-x,No
"Li, YZ; Pang, YW; Wang, J; Li, XL",Patient-specific ECG classification by deeper CNN from generic to dedicated,"This paper presents a new mechanism which is more effective for wearable devices to classify patient-specific electrocardiogram (ECG) heartbeats. In our method, a Generic Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) is trained first using a large number of heartbeats without distinguishing patients. Based on the GCNN, fine-tuning technique is applied to modify the GCNN to a Tuned Dedicated CNN (TDCNN) for the corresponding individual. Notably, only the GCNN instead of common training data is required to be stored into wearable devices. Moreover, only fine-tuning with several seconds rather than dozens of minutes is needed before the TDCNN is used to monitor the long-term ECG signals in clinical. To accelerate the ECG classification, only the original ECG heartbeat is input to the CNN without other extended information from the neighbor heartbeats or FFT representation. A deeper CNN architecture with small-scale convolutional kernels is adopted to improve the speed and accuracy for classification. With deeper CNN, hierarchical features can be extracted to help improve the accuracy of ECG classification. The state-of-the-art performance on efficiency and accuracy for ECG classification over MIT-BIH dataset is achieved by the proposed method. The effectiveness and superiority for detecting ventricular ectopic beats (VEB) and supraventricular ectopic beats (SVEB) events are demonstrated. The proposed mechanism of fine-tuning the GCNN to TDCNN improves the efficiency for training patient-specific CNN classifier.

"Romdhane, TF; Alhichri, H; Ouni, R; Atri, M",Electrocardiogram heartbeat classification based on a deep convolutional neural network and focal loss,"The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an effective tool for cardiovascular disease diagnosis and arrhythmia detection. Most methods proposed in the literature include the following steps: 1) denoizing, 2) segmentation into heartbeats, 3) feature extraction, and 4) classification. In this paper, we present a deep learning method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. CNN models can perform feature extraction automatically and jointly with the classification step. In other words, our proposed method does not require a feature extraction step with hand-crafted techniques. Our proposed method is also based on an algorithm for heartbeat segmentation that is different from most existing methods. In particular, the segmentation algorithm defines each ECG heartbeat to start at an R-peak and end after 1.2 times the median RR time interval in a 10-s window. This method is simple and effective, as it does not use any form of filtering or processing that requires assumptions about the signal morphology or spectrum. Although enhanced ECG heartbeat classification algorithms have been proposed in the literature, they failed to achieve high performance in detecting some heartbeat categories, especially for imbalanced datasets. To overcome this challenge, we propose an optimization step for the deep CNN model using a novel loss function called focal loss. This function focuses on minority heartbeat classes by increasing their importance. We trained and evaluated our proposed model with the MIT-BIH and INCART datasets to identify five arrhythmia categories (N, S, V, Q, and F) based on the Association for Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard. The evaluation results revealed that the focal loss function improved the classification accuracy for the minority classes as well as the overall metrics. Our proposed method achieved 98.41% overall accuracy, 98.38% overall F1-score, 98.37% overall precision, and 98.41% overall recall.

Nevertheless, training deep learning models normally requires a large amount of data and can lead to privacy concerns. Unfortunately, a large amount of healthcare data cannot be easily collected from a single silo. Additionally, deep learning models are like black-box, with no explainability of the predicted results, which is often required in clinical healthcare. This limits the application of deep learning in real-world health systems.

The federated setting is used to solve challenges such as data availability and privacy concerns. Furthermore, the proposed framework effectively classifies different arrhythmias using an autoencoder and a classifier, both based on a CNN. Additionally, we propose an XAI-based module on top of the proposed classifier for interpretability of the classification results, which helps clinical practitioners to interpret the predictions of the classifier and to make quick and reliable decisions.

The set of handcrafted features consists of three subsets namely, wavelet transform based morphological features representing localized signal behaviour, statistical features exhibiting overall variational characteristics of the signal and temporal features representing the signal's behaviour on the time axis. The proposed system utilizes a novel decision-level fusion of features for ECG classification by three different approaches; the first one uses normalized feature-level fusion of handcrafted global statistical and local temporal features by uniting these features into one set, the second one uses the morphological feature subset, and the third one combines features extracted from multiple layers of a CNN through using a score-level based refinement procedure. The main impact of the proposed approach is the score-level based fusion of automatically learned features extracted from multiple layers of trained CNN and the decision-level fusion of features characterising the signal in totally different representational spaces. The individual decisions of the three different classifiers are fused together based on the majority voting and a unified decision is reached for the input ECG signal classification. The results over the MIT-BIH arrhythmia benchmarks database exhibited that the proposed system achieves a superior classification accuracy compared to all of the state-of-the-art ECG classification methods.

"Teijeiro, T; Félix, P; Presedo, J; Castro, D",Heartbeat Classification Using Abstract Features From the Abductive Interpretation of the ECG,"Objective: This paper aims to prove that automatic beat classification on ECG signals can be effectively solved with a pure knowledge-based approach, using an appropriate set of abstract features obtained from the interpretation of the physiological processes underlying the signal. Methods: A set of qualitative morphological and rhythm features are obtained for each heartbeat as a result of the abductive interpretation of the ECG. Then, a QRS clustering algorithm is applied in order to reduce the effect of possible errors in the interpretation. Finally, a rule-based classifier assigns a tag to each cluster. Results: The method has been tested with the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database records, showing a significantly better performance than any other automatic approach in the state-of-the-art, and even improving most of the assisted approaches that require the intervention of an expert in the process. Conclusion: The most relevant issues in ECG classification, related to a large extent to the variability of the signal patterns between different subjects and even in the same subject over time, will be overcome by changing the reasoning paradigm.

"Guo, L; Sim, G; Matuszewski, B",Inter-patient ECG classification with convolutional and recurrent neural networks,"The recent advances in ECG sensor devices provide opportunities for user self-managed auto-diagnosis and monitoring services over the internet. This imposes the requirements for generic ECG classification methods that are inter-patient and device independent. In this paper, we present our work on using the densely connected convolutional neural network (DenseNet) and gated recurrent unit network (GRU) for addressing the inter-patient ECG classification problem. A deep learning model architecture is proposed and is evaluated using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and Supraventricular Databases. The results obtained show that without applying any complicated data pre-processing or feature engineering methods, both of our models have considerably outperformed the state-of-the-art performance for supraventricular (SVEB) and ventricular (VEB) arrhythmia classifications on the unseen testing dataset (with the F1 score improved from 51.08 to 61.25 for SVEB detection and from 88.59 to 89.75 for VEB detection respectively). As no patient-specific or device-specific information is used at the training stage in this work, it can be considered as a more generic approach for dealing with scenarios in which varieties of ECG signals are collected from different patients using different types of sensor devices.

"He, JY; Rong, J; Sun, L; Wang, H; Zhang, YC; Ma, JG",A framework for cardiac arrhythmia detection from IoT-based ECGs,"Cardiac arrhythmia has been identified as a type of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) that causes approximately 12% of all deaths globally. The development of Internet-of-Things has spawned novel ways for heart monitoring but also presented new challenges for manual arrhythmia detection. An automated method is highly demanded to provide support for physicians. Current attempts for automatic arrhythmia detection can roughly be divided as feature-engineering based and deep-learning based methods. Most of the feature-engineering based methods are suffering from adopting single classifier and use fixed features for classifying all five types of heartbeats. This introduces difficulties in identification of the problematic heartbeats and limits the overall classification performance. The deep-learning based methods are usually not evaluated in a realistic manner and report overoptimistic results which may hide potential limitations of the models. Moreover, the lack of consideration of frequency patterns and the heart rhythms can also limit the model performance. To fill in the gaps, we propose a framework for arrhythmia detection from IoT-based ECGs. The framework consists of two modules: a data cleaning module and a heartbeat classification module. Specifically, we propose two solutions for the heartbeat classification task, namely Dynamic Heartbeat Classification with Adjusted Features (DHCAF) and Multi-channel Heartbeat Convolution Neural Network (MCHCNN). DHCAF is a feature-engineering based approach, in which we introduce dynamic ensemble selection (DES) technique and develop a result regulator to improve classification performance. MCHCNN is deep-learning based solution that performs multi-channel convolutions to capture both temporal and frequency patterns from heartbeat to assist the classification. We evaluate the proposed framework with DHCAF and with MCHCNN on the well-known MIT-BIH-AR database, respectively. The results reported in this paper have proven the effectiveness of our framework.",61,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11280-019-00776-9,Yes

Ventricular tachyarrhythmia is an irregular and fast heart rhythm that emerges from inappropriate electrical impulses in the ventricles of the heart. Different types of arrhythmias are associated with different patterns, which can be identified. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is the major analytical tool used to interpret and record ECG signals. ECG signals are nonlinear and difficult to interpret and analyze. We propose a new deep learning approach for the detection of VA. Initially, the ECG signals are transformed into images that have not been done before. Later, these images are normalized and utilized to train the AlexNet, VGG-16 and Inception-v3 deep learning models. Transfer learning is performed to train a model and extract the deep features from different output layers. After that, the features are fused by a concatenation approach, and the best features are selected using a heuristic entropy calculation approach.

Approach: We propose a two-stage method named ENCASE for cardiac arrhythmia detection. The first stage is feature extraction and the second stage is classifier building. In the feature extraction stage, we extract both deep features and engineered features. Deep features are obtained by modifying deep neural networks into a deep feature extractor. Engineered features are extracted by summarizing existing approaches into four feature groups. Then, we propose a feature aggregation approach to combine these features. In the classifier building stage, we build multiple gradient boosting decision trees and combine them to get the final detector. Main results: Experiments are performed on the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017 dataset (Clifford et al 2017 Computing in Cardiology vol 44). Using F-1 scores reported on the hidden test set as measurements, ENCASE got 0.9117 on Normal (F-1N), 0.8128 on Atrial Fibrillation (AF) (F-1A), 0.7505 on Others (F-1O), and 0.5671 on Noise (F-1P). It placed 5th in the Challenge and 8th in the follow-up challenge (ranked by considering the average of Normal, AF, and Others (F-1NAO = 0.825)). When rounding to two decimal places, we were part a three-way tie for 1st place and were part a seven-way tie for 2nd place in the follow-up challenge. Further experiments show that combined features perform better than individual features, and deep features show more importance scores than other features.

Continuous monitoring of ECG on wearable devices can detect abnormality in the user's heartbeat early, thereby significantly increasing the chance of early intervention which is known to be the key to saving lives. In this paper, we present a set of inter-patient ECG classification methods that use convolutional (CNNs) and spiking neural networks (SNNs). We focused on inter-patient heartbeat classification, in which the model is trained over several patients and then used to infer that for patients not used in training. Raw heartbeat data is used in this paper because most wearable devices cannot deal with complex data preprocessing. A two-steps convolutional neural network testing method is proposed for saving power. For even greater energy-saving, a spiking neural network is also proposed.

This would allow to train more powerful models given the same amount of labeled data and to incorporate or improve predictions about rare diseases, for which training datasets are inherently limited. In this work, we put forward the first comprehensive assessment of self-supervised representation learning from clinical 12-lead ECG data. To this end, we adapt state-of-the-art self-supervised methods based on instance discrimination and latent forecasting to the ECG domain. In a first step, we learn contrastive representations and evaluate their quality based on linear evaluation performance on a recently established, comprehensive, clinical ECG classification task. In a second step, we analyze the impact of self-supervised pretraining on finetuned ECG classifiers as compared to purely supervised performance. For the best-performing method, an adaptation of contrastive predictive coding, we find a linear evaluation performance only 0.5% below supervised performance. For the finetuned models, we find improvements in downstream performance of roughly 1% compared to supervised performance, label efficiency, as well as robustness against physiological noise. This work clearly establishes the feasibility of extracting discriminative representations from ECG data via self-supervised learning and the numerous advantages when finetuning such representations on downstream tasks as compared to purely supervised training.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) is commonly used for detecting arrhythmias. Computer-aided diagnosis system can diagnose ECG automatically without the limitations of visual inspection. In order to improve the performance of ECG heartbeat classification, this paper proposes a novel automatic classification system. Based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network, a deep structure with multiple input layers is proposed. Four input layers are constructed based on different regions of a heartbeat and RR interval features. The first three inputs are convolved using different strides. The three outputs of CNN are then concatenated and go through an LSTM network. Two fully-connected layers follow and the output is concatenated with the fourth input. Eventually, the last fully-connected layer outputs the predicted label. The proposed system was evaluated by two division schemes of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database.

This study aims, in particular in task of automated electrocardiograms (ECG), to minimize the user variability in the CNN training by searching and optimizing the CNN parameters automatically. In the clinical practice, the task of ECG classification analysis is restricted by existing models' configuration. The hyper-parameters of the CNN model should be adjusted for the ECG classification problem. The best configuration for hyper-parameters is selected to have an impact on the production of the model. Deep knowledge of deep learning algorithms and suitable optimization techniques are also needed. Although there are many strategies for automated optimization, different benefits and disadvantages occur as they are applied to ECG classification problem. Here we present a CNN model for classification of non-ectopic (N), ventricular ectopic (V), supraventricular ectopic (S), and fusion (F) ECG rhythmias by the hybrid models based on modified version of Marine Predators algorithm (MPA) and CNN, known as the IMPA-CNN. The proposed model summarizes the feature extraction techniques of major features and, thus, outperforms other current classification models through automatically select the best hyper-parameters configuration of the CNN model. To reduce the time and complication complexity, optimum characteristics have been extracted directly from the raw signal using 1D-local binary pattern, higher order statistics, central moment, Hermite basis function discrete wavelet transform, and R-R intervals. Then, a modified version of MPA algorithm is used to select appropriate hyper-parameters for the CNN model like initial learning rate for the CNN model that is one of the major hyper parameters effect output performance, optimizer type which can be set to stochastic gradient descent (SGD), adaptive moment estimation (Adam), root mean square propagation (RMSprop), the activation function form used for modeling non-linear functions, set to 'Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), or 'sigmoid' and some other hyper-parameters are related to the optimization and training process of CNN model.

The time series signals contained in the signal are usually obtained by the professional medical staff and used for the classification of heartbeat diagnosis. Professional physicians can use the electrocardiogram to know whether the patient has serious congenital heart disease and whether there is an abnormal heart structure. A lot of work has been done to achieve automatic classification of arrhythmia types. For example, Autoencoder can obtain the time series characteristics of ECG signals and be used for ECG signal classification. However, some traditional methods are abstruse and difficult to understand in principle. In the classification of arrhythmias carried out in recent years, some researchers only use Autoencoder to provide structural characteristics, without giving too much explanation to the design reasons. Therefore, we optimized a new network layer design based on LSTM to obtain the autoencoder structure. This structure can cooperate with the ECG preprocessing process designed by us to obtain better arrhythmia classification effect. This method enables direct input of ECG signals into the model without complicated preprocessing such as manual parameter input. Also, it eliminates the gradient vanishing problem existing in traditional convolutional neural network.

High classification accuracy of interpatient electrocardiograms is extremely important for diagnosing Arrhythmia. The Supraventricular ectopic beat (S) is especially difficult to be classified. It is often misclassified as Normal (N) or Ventricular ectopic beat (V). Class imbalance is another common and important problem in electronic health (eHealth), as abnormal samples (i.e., samples of specific diseases) are usually far less than normal samples. To solve these problems, we propose a sustainable deep learning-based heart beat classification system, called BeatClass. It contains three main components: two stacked bidirectional long short-term memory networks (Bi-LSTMs), called Rist and Morst, and a generative adversarial network (GAN), called MorphGAN. Rist first classifies the heartbeats into five common Arrhythmia classes. The heartbeats classified as S and V by Rist are further classified by Morst to improve the classification accuracy. MorphGAN is used to augment the morphological and contextual knowledge of heartbeats in infrequent classes. In the experiment, BeatClass is compared with several state-of-the-art works for interpatient arrhythmia classification. The Fl-scores of classifying N, S, and V heartbeats are 0.6%, 16.0%, and 1.8% higher than the best baseline method. The experimental result demonstrates that taking multiple classification models to improve classification results step-by-step may significantly improve the classification performance.

After segmentation, the ECG heartbeats can be inputted into the first convolutional layers. In the proposed structure, kernels with different sizes are used in each convolution layer, which takes full advantage of the features in different scales. Then a max-pooling layer followed.

"Chen, AY; Wang, F; Liu, WH; Chang, S; Wang, H; He, J; Huang, QJ",Multi-information fusion neural networks for arrhythmia automatic detection,"Background and objectives:. The electrocardiograms (ECGs) are widely used to diagnose a variety of arrhythmias. Generally, the abnormalities of ECG signals mainly consist of ill-shaped ECG beat morphologies and irregular intervals. The ill-shaped ECG beat morphologies represent morphological information, while the irregular intervals denote the temporal information of ECG signals. But it is difficult to utilize morphological information and temporal information simultaneously when dealing with single ECG heartbeats, because RR interval is not contained in a single short heartbeat. Therefore, to handle this problems, a novel Multi-information Fusion Convolutional Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (MF-CBRNN) is proposed for arrhythmia automatic detection. Methods:. The MF-CBRNN is designed with two parallel hybrid branches that can simultaneously focus on the beat-based information in the ECG beats and the segment-based information in the adjacent segments of the beats. A single ECG beat provides the morphological information. At the same time, the adjacent segment of the ECG beat enriches the temporal information, so the two branches are designed to exploit the multiple information contained in ECGs. Furthermore, a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a bidirectional long short memory (BLSTM) in each branch is utilized to capture the information from the two inputs. And all the features extracted from the two branches are fused for information aggregation. Results:. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, the ECG signals from MIT-BIH databases are used for intra-patient and inter-patient paradigms. The proposed model yields an accuracy of 99.56% and an F1-score of 96.40% under the intra-patient paradigm.

"Zhai, XL; Zhou, ZH; Tin, C",Semi-supervised learning for ECG classification without patient-specific labeled data,"In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning-based ECG classification system for detection of supraventricular ectopic beats (SVEB or S beats) and ventricular ectopic beats (VEB or V beats) which does not require manual labeling of the patient-specific ECG data. Owing to inter-subject variability in ECG signal, patient-specific data is usually required to achieve good performance in ECG classification system. However, manual labeling of patient-specific data requires expert intervention, which is costly and time consuming. Our proposed system is based on a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) with inputs generated from heartbeat triplets. The system also consists of two auxiliary modules: a normal beat estimation module and an iterative beat label update algorithm. The normal beat estimation selects a small amount of patient-specific normal beats accurately from the testing ECG record in an unsupervised manner. These estimated normal beats are used, together with a common pool dataset, to train a preliminary patient-specific CNN classifier which provides initial labels for the testing data. These labels then undergo a semi-supervised iterative update process for improved performance. Our proposed system was evaluated on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The training of our proposed system is fully automatic, and its performance is comparable with several state-of-art supervised methods which require extra manual labeling of patient-specific ECG data. Our proposed system can be a useful tool for batch processing a large amount of ECG data in clinical applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

"Zhang, XB; Jiang, MZ; Wu, WQ; de Albuquerque, VHC",Hybrid feature fusion for classification optimization of short ECG segment in IoT based intelligent healthcare system,"With more than 50 million people worldwide at risk of heart disease, early diagnosis of cardiovascular disease is essential. The classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings can diagnose Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and other types of arrhythmia. Short ECG segments recorded from wearable devices in an IoT-based system can further provide continuous abnormality detection. The performance of ECG classification is usually high in normal segments, but much lower in the target classes, i.e., AF and other arrhythmias, which could result from class imbalance and limited feature representation. Deep learning methods have been employed as feature extractors in previous studies. Among them, convolutional neural networks (CNN) can generate rich features in different scales. But CNN may omit precise temporal information such as the duration between R-waves in two QRS waves (RR interval) irregularity, which is insensitive to noise segments. Thus, aiming at improving the classification performance of AF and other classes in short ECG segments, we propose a hybrid feature fusion method integrating the above-mentioned features. The fused features are trained and tested in a support vector machine classifier. The F1-score results show that our method outperforms not only the same CNN method without feature fusion in all the four classes, which average F1-score reached 84.3% and classification time per single sample of 0.005 s, but also several state-of-the-art methods, especially in the target classes, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed method. We then further discuss the impact of length on the performance of the proposed method, providing insights into future applications.",44,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-021-06693-1,No

The diagnosis is often made using electrocardiographic (ECG) signals but manual ECG interpretation by experts is expensive and time-consuming. In this work, we developed and validated an arrhythmia classification model based on handcrafted features, which was more computationally efficient than traditional deep learning models.

Automatic detection and classification of arrhythmia, as an effective tool of early warning, has recently been received more and more attention, especially in the applications of wearable devices for data capturing. However, different from traditional application scenarios, wearable electrocardio-gram (ECG) devices have some drawbacks, such as being subject to multiple abnormal interferences, thus making accurate ventricular contraction (PVC) and supraventricular premature beat (SPB) detection to be more chal-lenging.

In this paper, we propose a novel light model Lightweight Fussing Transformer to address these problems. We developed a more lightweight structure named LightConv Attention (LCA) to replace the self-attention of Fussing Transformer. LCA has reached remarkable performance level equal to or higher than self-attention with fewer parameters.

Nowadays, many studies have applied artificial intelligence (AI) methods to arrhythmia detection. Deep learning approaches can improve model performance but lack the capability to mine the relationship between the electrocardiogram (ECG) samples and final results. Furthermore, most arrhythmia diagnosis methods aim at only multiclassification problems. However, in many cases, an ECG recording may have more than one arrhythmia disease. In this article, we develop an accurate and interpretable model for multilabel ECG signals, which is called dual-level attentional convolutional long short-term memory neural network (DLA-CLSTM). Convolutional layers, bidirectional long short-term memory layers, and attention mechanisms are used for extracting beat- and rhythm-level information.

Hence, in these cases, it is worthy of trading, to some extent, classification accuracy in favor of earlier decisions when the time series data are collected over time. In this article, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning-based framework, snippet policy network V2 (SPN-V2), for long and varied-length multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) early classification. The proposed SNP-V2 contains two main components: snippet representation learning (SRL) and early classification timing learning (ECTL). The SRL is proposed to encode inner-snippet spatial correlations and inter-snippet temporal correlations into the hidden representations of the subsegment (snippet) of the input ECG. ECTL aims to learn a decision agent to classify the time series early and accurately.

Ensemble-based methods yield more robust uncertainty estimations than single network or stochastic methods. Although current methods still have limitations in accurately quantifying uncertainty, particularly in the case of dataset shift, incorporating uncertainty estimates with a classification with a rejection option improves the ability to detect such changes.

FECG monitoring is essential to provide accurate information on the state of the fetus. Severe fetal arrhythmia can cause heart failure or death. Therefore, it must be required to identify fetal arrhythmias early. The obtained ECG signals are very noisy and have artifacts from breathing and muscle contraction, which makes ECG extraction difficult. Misdiagnosis of fetal arrhythmias can lead to inappropriate treatment, which may result in further complications. If a defect has occurred in the heart of the fetus, it leads to death.

Initially, the input ECG signals are considered as Fetal ECG data base. The pre-processed ECG signals are extracted by Hexadecimal Local Adaptive Binary Pattern (HLABP). These extracting features are given to BSNN classifier for categorizing the output as normal and arrhythmia. Generally, BSNN does not adopt any optimization methods to determine the optimal parameters and to guarantee an exact classification.

Current ECG analysis methods primarily rely on the feature extraction of single leads or scales, thereby overlooking the critical complementary data obtainable from multiple channels and scales. This paper introduces the Multi-Scale Grid Transformer (MSGformer) network, which extracts spatial features from limb and chest leads and employs a multi-scale grid attention mechanism to capture temporal features. The self-attention mechanism-based multi-lead feature fusion approach leverages diverse leads' perspectives to reflect each lead's heart's comprehensive state and extract unique essential features. Furthermore, MSGformer incorporates a multi-scale grid attention feature extraction strategy that employs multi-head and multi-scale attention mechanisms to extract multi-scale temporal features from two dimensions. The MSGformer network combines these feature extraction strategies, resulting in simultaneous capturing of morphological characteristics across different leads and temporal characteristics within the same lead in ECG. This integration facilitates the effective detection of morphological abnormalities and erratic intervals in cardiac electrical activity. Utilizing the publicly available 2018 China Physiological Signal Challenge (CPSC 2018) and MIT-BIH electrocardiogram datasets, the performance of MSGformer was evaluated and compared to existing ECG classification models.

Recently, the edge computing-based federated learning has brought new opportunities and challenges. It is difficult to develop a lightweight HSD classification system for edge computing. In particular, the classification system should consider the dynamic characteristics of HSD, e.g., the change of data distributions and the appearance of initially unknown classes. To solve these problems, the paper proposes a scalable and transferable classification system, called SCALT. It is a one-classifier-per-class system based on federated learning. It comprises a one-dimensional convolution-based network for feature extraction, and an individual mini-classifier for each class. It is easy to be scaled when new class appears since only a mini-classifier will be trained. The feature extractor is updated only when it is transferred to a new task. SCALT has a parameter protection mechanism, which can avoid catastrophic forgetting in sequential HSD classification tasks.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most commonly used, noninvasive diagnostic tool for investigating various cardiovascular diseases. In real life, patients suffer from more than one heart disease at a time. So any practical automated heart disease diagnosis system should identify multiple heart diseases present in a single ECG signal. In this article, we propose a novel deep learning-based method for the multilabel classification of ECG signals. The proposed method can accurately identify up to two labels of an ECG signal pertaining to eight rhythm or morphological abnormalities of the heart and also the normal heart condition.

In the proposed method, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) with constructed ECG matrices. With the experiments conducted, we establish that training the CNN by taking only one label for each ECG signal data point is enough for the network to learn the features of an ECG point with multilabel information in it (multiple heart diseases at the same time).

"Xia, Y; Xu, YY; Chen, P; Zhang, J; Zhang, YL",Generative adversarial network with transformer generator for boosting ECG classification,"Arrhythmia is an important group of cardiovascular diseases, which can suddenly attack and cause sudden death, or continue to affect the heart and cause its failure. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important tool for detecting arrhythmia, but its analysis is time-consuming and dependent on extensive expertise. Deep neural networks have become a popular technique for automatically tracing ECG signals, and demonstrate great potentials to be more competent than human experts. However, most life-threatening arrhythmias are extremely rare, limiting the amount of examples available to train deep learning models. To address such a data imbalance problem, this study proposed a novel data augmentation protocol, i.e., a transformer and convolution-based generative adversarial network (TCGAN). Transformer is a recently proposed deep neural network based on the self -attention mechanism, which has powerful capabilities in learning the relationships between sequence ele-ments. The proposed TCGAN is utilized to generate heartbeat signals per type, which are then added to the original dataset to alleviate the data-imbalance problem. Experimental results on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database demonstrate that our TCGAN can generate ECG heartbeats with the waveforms being close to their real counterparts. In the inter-patient heartbeat classification paradigm, the overall accuracy of the proposed method is 94.69% in classifying heartbeats with type N, S, V, and F. Furthermore, the comparison with several state-of-the-art heartbeat classification systems demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed TCGAN in enhancing the ECG dataset.",19,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2022.104276,No

Recently, ECG classification using deep neural networks has been more accurate and efficient than traditional methods. Most ECG classification methods usually connect the 12-lead ECG into a matrix and then input this matrix into a deep neural network. We propose a multi-view and multi-scale deep neural network for ECG classification tasks considering different leads as different views, taking full advantage of the diversity of different lead features in a 12-lead ECG. The proposed network utilizes a multi-view approach to effectively fuse different lead features, and uses a multi-scale convolutional neural network structure to obtain the temporal features of an ECG at different scales. In addition, the spatial information and channel relationships of ECG features are captured by coordinate attention to enhance the feature representation of the network. Since our network contains six view networks, to reduce the size of the network, we also explore the distillation of dark knowledge from the multi-view network into a single-view network.

Automating this process with utmost accuracy is, therefore, highly desirable due to the advent of wearable ECG sensors. However, even with numerous deep learning approaches proposed recently, there is still a notable gap in the performance of global and patient-specific ECG classification performance. Methods: In this study, we propose a novel approach for inter-patient ECG classification using a compact 1D Self-ONN by exploiting morphological and timing information in heart cycles. We used 1D Self-ONN layers to automatically learn morphological representations from ECG data, enabling us to capture the shape of the ECG waveform around the R peaks. We further inject temporal features based on RR interval for timing characterization. The classification layers can thus benefit from both temporal and learned features for the final arrhythmia classification. Results: Using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia benchmark database, the proposed method achieves the highest classification performance ever achieved, i.e., 99.21% precision, 99.10% recall, and 99.15% F1-score for normal (N) segments; 82.19% precision, 82.50% recall, and 82.34% F1-score for the supra-ventricular ectopic beat (SVEBs); and finally, 94.41% precision, 96.10% recall, and 95.2% F1-score for the ventricular-ectopic beats (VEBs). Significance: As a pioneer application, the results show that compact and shallow 1D Self-ONNs with the feature injection can surpass all state-of-the-art deep models with a significant margin and with minimal computational complexity.

We then perform data augmentation on the segmented images to counter the effects of the class imbalance. The augmented images are then passed through a CNN feature extractor. The extracted features are then passed to a fuzzy clustering algorithm to classify the ECG signals for their respective cardio diseases.

"Han, HZ; Lian, C; Zeng, ZG; Xu, BR; Zang, JB; Xue, CY",Multimodal multi-instance learning for long-term ECG classification,"Recently, deep learning-based models have been widely used for electrocardiogram (ECG) classification tasks. Most ECG signals are long-term time series that contain a large number of sample points. However, existing deep learning-based models resize or crop the original long-term ECG signal due to the limitation of input size and hardware, which results in information loss. To address this issue, a multimodal multi-instance learning neural network (MAMIL) is proposed for long-term ECG classification. The proposed MAMIL has three major components. First, the original ECG signal and Gramian Angular Field (GAF) image converted from the ECG signal are utilized as multimodal inputs, which enables the model to learn complementary information between different modalities. Second, multi-instance learning (MIL) is introduced to avoid information loss. Each long-term ECG signal and GAF image are treated as bags, and each heartbeat from a long-term ECG signal and each patch from a GAF image are treated as instances. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are utilized to extract instance features from different modalities. Third, a novel attention mechanism-based feature fusion method is proposed to aggregate the instance features from multiple modalities to obtain the bag feature for final classification. Our feature fusion method adopts pooling to obtain positive instances, which can effectively eliminate redundant information and achieve low computational complexity. The proposed MAMIL is evaluated on both intrapatient and interpatient patterns of two commonly used ECG datasets. Experimental results show that our model not only outperforms common deep learning-based models, but also outperforms previous MIL-based models. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Early and accurate detection plays a key role in successful treatment and intervention. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for identifying a variety of cardiovascular abnormalities. In clinical practices and most of the current research, standard 12-lead ECG is mainly used. However, using a lower number of leads can make ECG more prevalent as it can be conveniently recorded by portable or wearable devices. In this research, we develop a novel deep learning system to accurately identify multiple cardiovascular abnormalities by using only three ECG leads which are I, II, and V1. Specifically, we use three separate One-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNNs) as backbones to extract features from three input ECG leads separately. The architecture of 1D-CNNs is redesigned for high performance and low computational cost. A novel Lead-wise Attention module is then introduced to aggregate outputs from these three backbones, resulting in a more robust representation which is then passed through a Fully-Connected (FC) layer to perform classification. Moreover, to make the system's prediction clinically explainable, the Grad-CAM technique is modified to produce a highly meaningful lead-wise explanation.

Arrhythmia is any irregularity of the heartbeat that causes an abnormality in the heart rhythm. Early detection of arrhythmia has great importance to prevent many diseases. Manual analysis of ECG recordings is not practical for quickly identifying arrhythmias that may cause sudden deaths. Hence, many studies have been presented to develop computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) systems to automatically identify arrhythmias.Methods: This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach to identify arrhythmias in ECG signals. The proposed approach identifies arrhythmia classes using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained by two-dimensional (2D) ECG beat images. Firstly, ECG signals, which consist of 5 different arrhythmias, are segmented into heartbeats which are transformed into 2D grayscale images. Afterward, the images are used as input for training a new CNN architecture to classify heartbeats.Results: The experimental results show that the classification performance of the proposed approach reaches an overall accuracy of 99.7%, sensitivity of 99.7%, and specificity of 99.22% in the classification of five different ECG arrhythmias. Further, the proposed CNN architecture is compared to other popular CNN architectures such as LeNet and ResNet-50 to evaluate the performance of the study.Conclusions: Test results demonstrate that the deep network trained by ECG images provides outstanding classification performance of arrhythmic ECG signals and outperforms similar network architectures. Moreover, the proposed method has lower computational costs compared to existing methods and is more suitable for mobile device-based diagnosis systems as it does not involve any complex preprocessing process.

In order to address this deficiency and further boost the patient-specific ECG classification performance, in this study, we propose 1D Self-organized Operational Neural Networks (1D Self-ONNs). Methods: Due to its self-organization capability, Self-ONNs have the utmost advantage and superiority over conventional ONNs where the prior operator search within the operator set library to find the best possible set of operators is entirely avoided. Results: Under AAMI recommendations and with minimal common training data used, over the entire MIT-BIH dataset 1D Self-ONNs have achieved 98% and 99.04% average accuracies, 76.6% and 93.7% average F1 scores on supra-ventricular and ventricular ectopic beat (VEB) classifications, respectively, which is the highest performance level ever reported.

Detecting long-term ECG recordings is time-consuming and error-prone for cardiologists. Deep neural networks (DNNs) can learn deep representations and empower automatic arrhythmia detection. However, when applying DNNs in practice, they usually suffer from domain shift that exits between the training data and testing data. Such shift can be caused by the high variability contained in ECG signals between patients and internal-variability of heartbeats for same patients, leading to degrading performance and impeding generalization of DNNs. To tackle this problem, we propose an unsupervised semantic-aware adaptive feature fusion network (USAFFN) to reduce such shift by alleviating the semantic distribution discrepancy between the feature spaces of two domains. Furthermore, an ECG contains rich information from different angles (beat, rhythm, and frequency levels), which is essential for arrhythmia detection. Therefore, a multi-perspective adaptive feature fusion (MPAFF) module is introduced to extract informative ECG representations.

Though, there is no such generic solution for detecting the arrhythmias at the moment they occur which is due to the non-stationary nature and inter-patient variations of ECG signals. The feature extraction and classification techniques are significant tools widely used in the automated classification of arrhythmias. This study aims to develop a personalized arrhythmia monitoring platform allowing real-time detection of arrhythmias from the subject's electrocardiogram (ECG) signal for point-of-care usage. A novel method, i.e. discrete orthogonal stockwell transform (DOST) technique for feature extraction is employed to capture the significant time-frequency coefficients to constitute the feature set representing each of the ECG signals. These coefficients or features are classified using artificial bee colony (ABC) optimized twin least-square support vector machine (LSTSVM) for classifying the different categories of ECG signals. The ABC optimizes the dimension of the feature set and the learning parameters of the classifier. The proposed method is prototyped on the commercially available ARM-based embedded platform and validated on the benchmark MIT-BIH arrhythmia database.

Notably, the nature of the ECG dataset made performance improvement possible by using a multireceptive field CNN (MRF-CNN). Using MRF-CNN, it is possible to design a model that considers semantic context information within ECG signals with different sizes.
